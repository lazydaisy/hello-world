Reminder of How things used to work.
History
-------
Having been messed about by Microsoft Windows10, I was broken hearted and lost when my PC stopped working.
It's hard to admit that I gave up, and sulked and then got ill and so decided to take some time out.
Now I feel better and ready to tackle getting back on track with GitHub.
